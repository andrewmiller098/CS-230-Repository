Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was Gaming Room and they wanted to build an application called Draw It or Lose It. It is currently only available on Android. It is a game that features two teams competing in several rounds. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I made it clear which platforms this application would work best on, and the pros and cons of each.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It helps to focus on the most importan aspects of the development of this application. It also helps savet time making you more efficient. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably revise the client side section of developmental requirements by adding more detail for which OS would be better and why.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took the most important parts and focused on those. I also decided which OS to work on primarily to save more time. Since this is an application with a focus on multiplayer I also focused on those aspects. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached this by putting scalability, portability, and ease of use first. I want this application to have a healthy life cycle well after launch so I focused on updates and maintenance, as well. In the future I would probably focus on memory and storage management more on a similar project.
